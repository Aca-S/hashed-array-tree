# Hashed Array Tree

A more memory efficient implementation of the std::vector collection, as proposed by Edward Sitarski in his article in the 1996. September issue of Doctor Dobb's journal.

The implementation supports most of the std::vector operations, usage of iterators, as well as the usage of custom memory allocators. The entirety of the implementation is hosted in the hat_vector.hpp header file.
